Mutated Properties - a simple HTML property-configuration UI,
autogenerated from your classes.

.. * Free software: MIT license
.. * Documentation: https://mutaprops.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

* Generate a self-documented web UI directly from your objects with simple decorators
* UI state automatically updated with object state changes (through websockets)
* Supports multiple UI views on the same object
* Supports chaining of UI's from multiple machines
* Customize the UI with your own stylesheet
* Add any widget you like with direct HTML support
* Log console capturing all your Python logging
* Asyncio support

How does it work?
-----------------

Imagine a normal Python class:

.. code-block:: python

    class Hoovercraft:

        def __init__(number_of_eels=10):
            self._eel_count = number_of_eels



Class MutaProps
---------------

Class-scoped mutaprops are currently not supported.

Class mutaselects
-----------------

Class-scoped mutaselects are there to allow selects updated for all objects
of given class. The implementation and syntax is sligtly different from normal
selects, due to the fact that it's impossible to override some default Python
behaviours to mimick class-based properties without changing Abstract Base Class
of the original decorated class.

The classes to which the class-scoped mutaselects are assigned to are identified
by it's python type object id (which is, in turn, derived from memory address).
That means that sharing of a class is limited within the Python interpreter
process.
